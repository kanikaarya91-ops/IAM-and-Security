# AWS Access Key Management & User Support Guide

## Project Overview
This project focuses on managing AWS access keys securely and providing clear, step-by-step guidance for users to reset their AWS access keys and update their CLI credentials.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate how to create, rotate, and revoke AWS access keys.
- Provide a user-friendly Knowledge Base (KB) article to help users troubleshoot access issues.
- Highlight security best practices for credential management.
- Document the full support process from incident identification to resolution.

## Problem Scenario
Users often lose access to AWS CLI due to expired or compromised access keys. This causes workflow disruption and requires timely resolution.

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed AWS IAM user access key policies.
2. Created a detailed KB article with screenshots and CLI commands.
3. Simulated a support ticket scenario to reset access keys.
4. Guided users to update their local AWS CLI configuration.
5. Recommended preventive measures including key rotation schedules.

## Key Learnings
- Importance of credential security and rotation.
- Communicating complex processes in simple, clear steps.
- Role of documentation in reducing ticket volume.
